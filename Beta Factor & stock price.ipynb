For example, if a company undergoes a stock split, the number of shares increases, and the market price per share decreases. The adjusted close price reflects this change, allowing for more accurate long-term price comparisons.\n",

    "1. **Meaning of Beta Value**:\n",
    "   - **Beta = 1**: The stock or portfolio's price movements are consistent with the market. If the market increases or decreases by 1%, the stock or portfolio also moves approximately 1%.\n",
    "   - **Beta > 1**: The stock or portfolio is more volatile than the market. For example, a Beta of 1.5 means that for every 1% increase in the market, the stock or portfolio might rise by 1.5%; for every 1% decline, it might fall by 1.5%.\n",
    "   - **Beta < 1**: The stock or portfolio's price movements are less than the market. For example, a Beta of 0.5 indicates that the stock or portfolio moves about half as much as the market does.\n",
    "   - **Beta < 0**: The stock or portfolio moves inversely to the market. This is less common and typically seen in certain hedging strategies or special asset categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation of Beta Value**:\n",
    "   Beta is typically calculated through statistical analysis by dividing the covariance of the stock returns with the market returns by the variance of the market returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications of Beta Value**:\n",
    "   - **Risk Management**: Investors use Beta to assess and manage the market risk of a portfolio.\n",
    "   - **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: In the CAPM, Beta is used to calculate the expected return of an asset, helping investors decide whether an investment is attractive.\n",
    "   - **Portfolio Construction**: By mixing assets with high and low Betas, investors can adjust the overall risk level of a portfolio according to their risk tolerance.\n"
